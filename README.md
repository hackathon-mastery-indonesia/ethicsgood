# EthicsGood

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this project after noticing that many young generations in my country lack ethics. One of the issues in my country is the neglect of ethics nowadays. Through this project, I aim to provide wide-ranging ethics education by harnessing AI.

## What it does
EthicsGood is an innovative interactive platform designed to serve as your personal guide to ethics and etiquette, powered by advanced artificial intelligence technology. Whether you are navigating professional settings, social interactions, or ethical dilemmas, EthicsGood is here to provide insightful guidance every step of the way. Additionally, by participating in interactive ethics quizzes, you'll strengthen your grasp of ethical concepts and refine your ability to apply them effectively in real-world situations, whether in personal relationships, social interactions, or civic engagements.

## How we built it
I utilized Azure, Next.js, and PostgreSQL to complete this project.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced performance issues due to the complexity of backend processing and encountered perplexing prompt engineering challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating educational content using AI.

## What we learned
Learning to use contemporary AI tools.

## What's next for EthicsGood
The project needs to add a video conference feature with ethics mentors and a feature for scenario-based ethics cases between users and AI. However, due to time constraints, we have not yet implemented these features.
